I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, Arizona State University, advised by [Dr. Hasti Seifi](https://hastiseifi.com/). Previously, I earned my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University (2023) and my Bachelor’s degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (2021).

I work on Human-AI Interaction and Haptics. My research explores multimodal haptic perception and develops AI-powered computational systems and tools for designing perceptually grounded haptic experiences.
